GBS is a free, open-source, and cross-platform implementation of the Game Boy console written in C++14 with a single library dependency of SFML.

Running the emulator
------------------------------------------
To run after building: GameBoyEmulator.exe -game="Super Mario Land 2.gb"

Controls
------------------------------------------
Controls for the emulator are currently hard-coded.
* Z = B
* X = A
* Enter = Start
* Shift = Select
* 1 through 9 = Choose save state slot
* S = Save game state for current slot
* L = Load game state for current slot
* P = Save screenshot

Note
------------------------------------------
GBS is very much in the early stages of development and is not an accurate emulator. Additionally, most of the features of other emulators are lacking. That being said, it still can play most Game Boy games.

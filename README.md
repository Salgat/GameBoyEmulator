GBS is a free, open-source, and cross-platform implementation of the Game Boy console written in C++14 with a single library dependency of SFML.

To run after building: GameBoyEmulator.exe -game="Super Mario Land 2.gb"

GBS is very much in the early stages of development and is not an accurate emulator. Additionally, most of the features of other emulators are lacking. That being said, it still can play most Game Boy games.

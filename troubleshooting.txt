loops until it finally hits PC: 0xC000
call @ 0xC24C to 0xCE31 draws the first line

The big calls start at PC: 0xC246 (4 calls), the third calling the draw routine

For whatever reason, it loses position and is trying to execute C24D instead of C24C, so need to find which instruction is screwing up the program_counter

01-special

PC = 0xC31A is where POP AF test starts

PC = 0xC359 is where the "test has passed jump" is located (specifically the "call 0xC0C2" located at PC = 0xC18F, and more specifically PC = 0xC7C8's call to 0xC3FD)

crc_update is at PC = 0xC33F

X at PC = 0xC33D, the daa instruction (0x27) is setting the flag to 0x00, not 0x80 like it should.

From c06a to c06c, the SRL B instruction should be flag = 0x10 instead of 0x00
	- Instructions need all binary operations to be wrapped in parenthesis due to their low priority! (such as (0xF&AF.lower))
	
At PC = 0xC356, check_crc $6A9F8D8A is called
	- The value at 0xFF80 at this point should be 0x75, but it's loading into A the value 0x95?

Implement graphics now. When Scanline is incremented in the timer, call "RenderScanLine" or however it works using the implementation.
Get Background, Window, and Sprite finished, including inversion, flipping, etc.
